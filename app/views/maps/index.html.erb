  <p>This example shows drawing simple vector features -- point, line, polygon
  in different styles, created 'manually', by constructing the entire style
  object, via 'copy', extending the default style object, and by
  inheriting the default style from the layer.</p>
  <p>It also shows how to use external graphic files for point features
  and how to set their size: If either graphicWidth or graphicHeight is set,
  the aspect ratio of the image will be respected. If both graphicWidth and
  graphicHeight are set, it will be ignored. Alternatively, if graphicWidth
  and graphicHeight are omitted, pointRadius will be used to set the size
  of the image, which will then be twice the value of pointRadius with the
  original aspect ratio.</p>
  <p><b>TODO:</b> Use OSM mapnik as base map, take care with projections (we should maybe
  use the default OSM projection in our database and datamodel). <br />
  use Coffescript and HAML</p>
